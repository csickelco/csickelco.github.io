# Newbie Log

## Overview
Newbie Log is a voice-enabled newborn and infant tracking application that works on any Alexa-enabled device, like the Amazon Echo. It's a hands-free way to log your baby's feeds, sleep, diapers, activity, and weight -- information that's helpful to have for visits to the pediatrician and your own records.
